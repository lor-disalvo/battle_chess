# Battle Chess

Have you ever played Chess and thought "I think each Piece should have a unique set of abilities", or
"I really like this but it's a bummer I cannot move the Pieces as I please."

Well, look no further, my inexplicably pedantic friend, for this is a version of Chess that combines
an approximation of D&D 5e Combat Rules with the beloved game of Chess.

## But Why Though?
Because.

Also, to refine my knowledge of Flutter.

## How does this even work?
All Pieces have a Health Bar, a Movement Speed, a Base Damage and a Set of Abilities they can use.
The Player takes control of the King, which gives orders to one other Piece per turn with the 
objective of destroying the opponent's King. 

To do this, you have to attack the opponent's Pieces with your own.
